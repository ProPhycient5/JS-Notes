# Execution context in JS comes to picture, when we run any JS code in a web browser.

The browser's JavaScript engine plays a pivotal role in creating a special environment (or space) to deal with the transformation and execution of this JavaScript code.

For the better understanding, I have attached a diagram in order to explain how **Excecution Context** works.
